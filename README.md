# mytipcalc
# This is my calucaltor project based on calculating the tip for a meal.
# The tip calculation is referenced to the sales tax used in California.
# You input your meal cost.
# Then you input the tip percentage of the meal, minimum is 3%.
# The program will output a tip for that meal.
# PS. Dont forget to wear your masks, and tip generously.
